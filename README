# Honu

Your sea turtle research was going swell--until this morning when you realized one of the turtles you've been tracking hasn't moved for three days. The coordinates of Honu's location are for a sand bank in the ocean, and without any clue why he's been stuck there, you set out to find him. Can you save Honu from this fishy situation, or will you be unable to sail past the obstacles?

Honu is a top-down, 2-D adventure game made in two weeks time for AdventureJam 2016 by Brendan Geck (bpgeck), Vanessa Gutierrez, and Brazen Abelgas (xyzgon).
